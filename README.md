This repo contains my arch linux configs along with an automation script for full installation of said configs. Note that I have tried this script only a few times and WILL be buggy. Use at your own risk.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wintersunset95/Arch-Dotfiles.git
```
2. Run the install script
```bash
cd Arch-Dotfiles
